### Objectives

The purpose of this project is for you to calculate the following:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

### Instructions

The program reads from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned above. In other words,  program reads the data present in the path passed as argument. The data in the file will be presented as the following example:

```console
189
113
121
114
145
110
...
```

This data represents a graph in which the values of the x axis are the number of the lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...) and the values of the y axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110...).


After reading the file, given program executes each of the calculations asked above and print the results in the following manner (the following numbers are only examples):

```console
Average: 35
Median: 4
Variance: 5
Standard Deviation: 65
```

### Testing

To test program,:

Run donwloaded script file ./math-skills

After that it will be data.txt created.

By next run following command:

```sh
$> go run main.go data.txt
```
